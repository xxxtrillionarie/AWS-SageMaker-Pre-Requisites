# AWS-SageMaker-Pre-Requisites

Please find some references and notebook examples of the sagemaker services we are going to utilize in lab. The main github repo has hundreds of examples of notebooks covering almost all of the sagemaker services.



This is automatically provided as a reference tab in sagemaker notebooks , but not inside sagemaker studio . It would be great if you can clone this into your local repository inside sagemaker studio env (your main development platform will be sagemaker studio IDE for lab).



Main sagemaker examples Github - https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples.git. ( You need to have an internet connection to clone this repo in your studio environment )


Below are some reference notebooks for different sagemaker services.  Please note these are some samples only and there are many more which you can choose from the repo.

As a housekeeping activity for ensuring all the connections are in correctly place in your VPC environment can be to check whether you can run any of the above notebooks inside sagemaker Studio environment.



Example - https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/aws_sagemaker_studio/sagemaker-python-sdk/scikit_learn_iris/Scikit-learn%20Estimator%20Example%20With%20Batch%20Transform.ipynb
